SUGGESTIONS.
<BR>
_______________
</DIV>
<BR>
T<SMALL>HE</SMALL> characters in this little sketch should be
played by prominent citizens of your town, if such can be prevailed
upon to appear&mdash;the more elderly, staid,
and incongruous in years and bearing, the better.
Dignified professors, judges, doctors, lawyers, teachers, etc.,
should be prevailed upon to forget their present greatness,
don the costumes and revive the scenes of their youth.
<P>
The dress may be left largely to individual taste.
Short pantaloons, jumpers, long-sleeved tires, caps, broad-brimmed straw hats,
heavy cowhide boots, are suggested for the gentlemen;
while short dresses, the historic pantalette, sun-bonnets,
tires, aprons, etc., are proposed for the ladies.
The latter should have their hair braided or hanging in long curls.
All should be neatly dressed in &ldquo;ye olden time&rdquo; costumes, except one or two,
who may represent the tatterdemalion fraternity.
One of these may be the bright boy of the class, the other the dullard,
who stumbles through his lessons, loses his place,
has a passion for catching flies, throwing spit-balls, etc.
One boy may have a penchant for drawing pictures on his slate
or the blackboard, in which his teacher and mates play a prominent part
as models. One girl a proneness for chewing gum, another for large pickles;
another thinks herself smart, but generally manages to give wrong answers.
A few names have been suggested in the dialogue,
but they may be easily varied. Where a name is not necessary,
the author has used the word &ldquo;Pupil,&rdquo; so that the parts
may be distributed according to the number of performers.
<P>
The by-play that goes on among the scholars who are not reciting
must be of such a nature that it will not attract the attention
of the teacher unless it is a part of the programme.
<P>
The motion song can be introduced elsewhere in the dialogue if advisable.
<P>
As a rule, pupils should raise hands (at the same time saying &ldquo;Huh! huh!&rdquo;
or snapping thumb and finger), and obtain
permission before speaking; but where the dialogue becomes
spirited, this rule may be broken.
<P>
An indefinite number can take part in this entertainment.

                          <BIG CLASS="LARGE">INTRODUCTION.</BIG>
<BR>
</DIV>
<BR>
T<SMALL>HE</SMALL> curtain should rise upon an introductory front
scene depicting the pupils on their way to school, singly,
or in groups of two or three, swinging book-bags or dinner-pails;
one group of girls play bean-bag; a group of boys play marbles;
one boy tries to fly a kite; some skip, others walk sedately,
or jump rope, drive hoop, etc.
<BR>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
(<I>Enter</I> B<SMALL>OY</SMALL>, <I>whittling</I>.)
<BR>
</DIV>
<P>
B<SMALL>OY</SMALL>. Say, Seth, old Hickory&rsquo;s coming! Got your hands all waxed, sonny?
&rsquo;Cause you&rsquo;ll have to ketch it hot and heavy this morning.
Teacher&rsquo;s awful mad about your stealing Squire Green&rsquo;s apples.
<P>
S<SMALL>ETH </SMALL>C<SMALL>RANE</SMALL> (<I>who has book-bag, etc.</I>). Don&rsquo;t care.
I ain&rsquo;t going to school to-day, anyway.
I&rsquo;m going to play hookey.
<P>
B<SMALL>OY</SMALL>. Did your ma say you might?
<P>
S<SMALL>ETH</SMALL>. Bet your life she didn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m not tied to my ma&rsquo;s apron strings,
Bubby; I&rsquo;m no baby!
<P>
B<SMALL>OY</SMALL>. Here he comes! Run, Seth, or he&rsquo;ll ketch you.
<P>
(S<SMALL>ETH</SMALL> <I>runs off. Teacher passes along saying &ldquo;Good-morning&rdquo; etc.,
	to children.</I>)
<P>
B<SMALL>OY</SMALL>. (<I>still whittling, to group which comes up</I>).
Say, boys, Seth Crane&rsquo;s going to play hookey.
Let&rsquo;s pay, him back for saying we stole Squire Green&rsquo;s apples,
will you, and tell his mother? She&rsquo;s a daisy, though, ain&rsquo;t she?
<P>
S<SMALL>ECOND </SMALL>B<SMALL>OY</SMALL>. Agreed! But who&rsquo;ll tell the old lady?
<P>
B<SMALL>OY</SMALL>. Let Daniel. He&rsquo;s teacher&rsquo;s pet anyway, and if he&rsquo;s late,
nothing&rsquo;ll be said. Will you go, Dan?
<P>
D<SMALL>ANIEL</SMALL>. Yes. The old lady&rsquo;ll give me some of her nice doughnuts.
(<I>Smacking lips, he runs off. Boys pass off in other direction,
crying, &ldquo;Save some for us, Dan,&rdquo; etc.</I>)
<P>
The above merely serves to indicate the general nature of the dialogue
that may be characteristically employed,
the precise points to be made depending for their humorous value
so entirely upon the identity of the actor in each case
and their contradiction of his well-known character and dignity,
that they must be left to the invention of the players.
The dialogue, whatever its nature, should be accompanied by an
incessant pantomimic action of characteristic boyish antics
and practical jokes, made inexpressibly ludicrous by whiskers,
bass voices, and other personal anachronisms.
<P>
At the close of this introductory part,
and while the curtain is rising on the school scene,
a large bell should be rung vigorously.

</DIV>
<P>
S<SMALL>CENE</SMALL>.&mdash;<I>The interior of the little red schoolhouse
of our grandfathers. Teacher&rsquo;s desk at R., stove L.,
chair for committee man in front of stove, desks at back,
leaving an open space in front for classes, etc.
Blackboard and map at back. Blackboard down in R.&nbsp;corner,
by teacher&rsquo;s desk, facing house. Door at back, C.
<BR>
<BR>
As pupils enter they courtesy to the teacher,
and after hanging hats and bonnets on nails, take their seats.
One pupil is granted the privilege of ringing the bell at the door,
whereupon the rest enter.
The school is them called to order and the roll is read.
Each answers &ldquo;here&rdquo; or &ldquo;present&rdquo; to his name.
When the name of &ldquo;James Peters&rdquo; is read there is no reply.
At length one of the girls explains that he &ldquo;had to stay to hum to
mind the baby.&rdquo; Another scholar reports that &ldquo;the reason Molly Jenkins
didn&rsquo;t come was because she hadn&rsquo;t no shoes.&rdquo;</I>
<BR>
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. I see a few new scholars here. I will now take their names.
What name do you call yourself, sir?
<P>
J.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;S<SMALL>MITH</SMALL>. I don&rsquo;t call myself any names! But Nappy Jones does,
and ef he ever does it again (<I>doubling up his fists and threatening the same,
	who returns the compliment&nbsp;</I>), I&rsquo;ll lick him, see ef I don&rsquo;t!
My name is Julius Caesar Smith, and don&rsquo;t you forget it.
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. How old are you, Julius Caesar?
<P>
J.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;S. I&rsquo;m five years old next Christmas.
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. That will do. The next scholar.
<P>
J.&nbsp;C<SMALL>ALL</SMALL>. I&rsquo;m Jule Call, and my brother&rsquo;s name is Bill Call.
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. Your brother can speak for himself.
It is very improper to say &ldquo;Jule&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bill;&rdquo; you should say Julius.
Now, what is your name?
<P>
J.&nbsp;C. Julius Call, sir.
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. Next?
<P>
B.&nbsp;C<SMALL>ALL</SMALL>. Bilious Call, sir.
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. What, sir!
<P>
B.&nbsp;C. Bilious Call. (<I>In surprise.</I>)
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. There is no such proper name as &ldquo;Bilious.&rdquo;
Your name is probably William.
<P>
J.&nbsp;C. He&rsquo;s my brother Bill anyway,
and ef I&rsquo;m Julius he&rsquo;s Bilious,
ain&rsquo;t we?
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. Silence I want no impudence from any of my pupils.
(J<SMALL>ULIUS</SMALL>, <I>silenced but not convinced,
shakes his head and gesticulates to his friends,
all of whom show him their sympathy with his views.</I>)
What is your name, my dear?
<P>
Z.&nbsp;S. Zenobia Snellings, may it please you, sir.
(<I>Makes low courtesy.</I>)
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. Are you a native of this place?
<P>
Z.&nbsp;S. Yes, sir&mdash;part of the year.
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. Part of the year! What do you mean?
<P>
Z.&nbsp;S. Vacations I spend with Aunt Nancy at
__________&nbsp;.
(<I>Supply a neighboring town.</I>)
<P>
(<I>Interruption in the shape of</I>&nbsp; D<SMALL>ANIEL </SMALL>W<SMALL>EBSTER </SMALL>T<SMALL>OMKINS</SMALL>,
<I>who rushes in out of breath and trips over the threshold,
upsetting lunch basket, revealing contents.</I>)
<P>
D.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;T. Has bell rang?
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL> (<I>severely pointing to the door</I>). Try that again, Daniel.
<P>
D.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;T. I got enough of it that time.
Let some other feller try it. (<I>Rubbing knees and elbows.</I>)
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. Sit down, sir.
<P>
D.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;T. Wait till I pick up some of these cold wittles round here.
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL> (<I>resuming</I>). Next, what shall I call you?
<P>
V.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;W. Venus Matildy Weeks. I&rsquo;m her sister. (<I>Pointing.</I>)
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. Her name&rsquo;s Snellings and yours Weeks; how&rsquo;s that?
<P>
V.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;W. Well, we didn&rsquo;t used to be any relation,
but we married her mother&mdash;me and my father.
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. Oh, I see a second marriage. Who are you? (<I>Silence.</I>)
I mean the boy with red hair. (<I>Boys nudge and girls giggle.</I>)
<P>
C.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;F. (<I>rising slowly.</I>) C-C-C-Christopher
C-C-C-Colum-b-b-b-bus F-F-Fitts.
I st-st-st-stutter! (<I>Sitting.</I>)
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. Ah! do you?
<P>
C.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;F. (<I>rising slowly</I>).
Ye-ye-yes, sir! s-s-s-s-sometimes. (<I>Sitting.</I>)
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. Next!
<P>
B.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;S. (<I>drawling</I>). My father knows you.
He used ter go to school with you.
Says you and him played hookey one day and tumbled inter
the mill-pond&mdash;and&mdash;he! he! ye both got a flogging!&mdash;My name&rsquo;s
Benjamin Franklin Squeers, like my father&rsquo;s. (<I>Scholars titter.</I>)
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. That will do, Benjamin Franklin.
Your father evidently had some one else in mind.
The class may sing the multiplication table.
(<I>Class sing &ldquo;Five times one are five,&rdquo; etc.,
to the tune of Yankee Doodle.</I>)
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. You may now all take your books and slates.
The infant class may pass out on the floor.
You may look at the words on the board and get ready to read them.
(<I>Class forms a semicircle in front of teacher&rsquo;s desk or board.
Teacher writes the following on board:</I>)
<P>
&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Herod the tetrarch.
<BR>
&nbsp;2.&nbsp;This is a worm; do not tread on it.
<BR>
&nbsp;3.&nbsp;This is the heir; come, let us kill him.
<P>
F<SMALL>IRST </SMALL>B<SMALL>OY</SMALL> (<I>reads slowly</I>). He&mdash;rode&mdash;the&mdash;Don&rsquo;t
know that word.
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. Didn&rsquo;t I tell you to study while I was writing?
<P>
B<SMALL>OY</SMALL>. Yes, sir. (<I>Crying.</I>)
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. Then go on.
<P>
B<SMALL>OY</SMALL>. Boo-hoo! I can&rsquo;t read it.
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. Try it again immediately.
<P>
B<SMALL>OY</SMALL>. He (<I>boo-hoo!&nbsp;</I>) rode&mdash;the&mdash;tater&mdash;cart!
(<I>Weeps profusely.</I>)
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. Next scholar read it.
<P>
G<SMALL>IRL</SMALL>. Herod&mdash;the&mdash;the&mdash;the (<I>is prompted by someone&nbsp;</I>)
the tetrarch.
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. Very good. Next boy, the second sentence.
<P>
B<SMALL>OY</SMALL>. This&mdash;is&mdash;a&mdash;warm&mdash;This&mdash;is&mdash;a&mdash;warm&mdash;doughnut&mdash;tread on it.
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL> (<I>presenting dunce cap</I>).
Put that on and stand in the corner.
(<I>Boy scuffs to corner, where he spends his time throwing spitballs
and eating doughnuts, thrown him by pupils when the teacher is not looking.</I>)
Next read. (<I>Boy steps up to ask teacher about an example.</I>)
<P>
G<SMALL>IRL</SMALL> (<I>prompted by one of the boys</I>).
Thith ith a wurrum. Be&mdash;careful&mdash;not&mdash;to&mdash;tread&mdash;on&mdash;it
(<I>again prompted&nbsp;</I>), or it will bite you.
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL> (<I>to boy</I>). You have multiplied wrong.
Let me see: five times nine are forty-five,
put down the five and carry the four, etc.
(<I>Class push and pull, but straighten into line
when the teacher looks up</I>). Next read.
<P>
B<SMALL>OY</SMALL>. This&mdash;is&mdash;the&mdash;hair&mdash;comb. Let&mdash;us&mdash;kill&mdash;him!
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. I am ashamed of you. Does <I>c-o-m-e</I> spell
comb? (<I>Sends boy with slate to his seat.</I>)
Hands up&mdash;those who can tell me what it does spell. Well, John?
<P>
J<SMALL>OHN</SMALL>. It spells <I>come</I>.
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. Right. You may read it.
<P>
J<SMALL>OHN</SMALL>. This&mdash;is&mdash;the&mdash;hair.
Come&mdash;let&mdash;us&mdash;kill&mdash;him. Ow-oo-oo! (<I>Dancing round.</I>)
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. Well, John! What&rsquo;s the matter?
<P>
J<SMALL>OHN</SMALL>. Somebody pulled my hair!
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL> (<I>severely</I>). Who pulled John&rsquo;s hair?
<P>
P<SMALL>UPIL</SMALL>. I did; I couldn&rsquo;t help it. (<I>Hanging head.</I>)
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. Couldn&rsquo;t help pulling hair! That is a likely story. You may pass to the foot.
<P>
P<SMALL>UPIL</SMALL>. No, I couldn&rsquo;t. I went to raise my hand and his hair was
right in the way. (<I>Scuffs to foot.</I>)
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. I will try you on one more sentence,
and if you cannot read that properly you must take your seats and study.
(<I>Writes: &ldquo;Stephen says that the girls are knitting.&rdquo;&nbsp;</I>) Next read.
<P>
P<SMALL>UPIL</SMALL>. Step-hen! (<I>Hands of class go up.</I>)
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. Wrong! Next! (<I>Is interrupted by boy who wants a drink.
Two boys are appointed to get a bucket of water and pass it
to the others in tin cups.</I>)
<P>
N<SMALL>EXT </SMALL>P<SMALL>UPIL</SMALL>. Stephen&mdash;says&mdash;that&mdash;the&mdash;girls&mdash;are&mdash;kissing.
(<I>Boys laugh.</I>)
<P>
G<SMALL>IRL</SMALL> (<I>indignantly</I>). He didn&rsquo;t read that right!
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. Very well. You may read it.
<P>
G<SMALL>IRL</SMALL> (<I>still unmollified&nbsp;</I>). Stephen says that girls are kittens.
<P>
(<I>Teacher sends class to seats in disgrace to study their lesson.</I>)
<P>
B<SMALL>OY</SMALL> (<I>in seat</I>). Teacher, how many is five less one?
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. Think that out yourself.
If there were five crows in Squire Green&rsquo;s
field and you should shoot one,
how many would there be left?
<P>
B<SMALL>OY</SMALL>. Only one.
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. What? Think again.
<P>
B<SMALL>OY</SMALL>. The other four would fly off, wouldn&rsquo;t they?
<P>
G<SMALL>IRL</SMALL> (<I>raising hand&nbsp;</I>).
How many scruples are there in a drachm?
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. Jonathan, tell Maria how many scruples there are in a drachm.
<P>
J<SMALL>ONATHAN</SMALL>. Don&rsquo;t know, only that ma said as how pa took his dram
every morning without any scruples.
I guess some drams don&rsquo;t have no scruples.
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. Both of you refer to your tables.
<P>
G<SMALL>IRL</SMALL> (<I>raising hand&nbsp;</I>). Teacher, why does an elephant have a trunk?
<P>
B<SMALL>OY</SMALL> (<I>raising hand&nbsp;</I>). So&rsquo;s&rsquo;t he&rsquo;d be an elephant, of course!
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. I will now hear the class in history.
(<I>They pass out to places, the boys trying to get a drink on the way</I>.)
The first scholar may tell me something about Christopher Columbus.
<P>
F<SMALL>IRST </SMALL>G<SMALL>IRL</SMALL>. Christopher was once a little boy like me&mdash;no,
I mean he was a little girl like me&mdash;no, I don&rsquo;t!&mdash;well,
he went to school like me anyway. His mother&rsquo;s name was Geneva.
<P>
B<SMALL>OY</SMALL>. Hoh! It wasn&rsquo;t either. That was his father&rsquo;s name.
<P>
A<SMALL>NOTHER </SMALL>G<SMALL>IRL</SMALL>. Teacher, wasn&rsquo;t Geneva where he was born?
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. Yes, Mary, go on.
<P>
M<SMALL>ARY</SMALL>. Somebody bought him a yacht or a steamer,
I believe, and one Friday he sailed over here to America
and asked us if we had been discovered yet,
and we told him &ldquo;No.&rdquo; &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have.&rdquo;
So he took some of our Indians home with him to tell the king
that they had been discovered, and we named the United States after him.
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. That is right in the main.
One or two points I might take exceptions to.
The next may take George Washington and tell us about him.
(<I>Is interrupted by a boy in seat who raises his hand and asks
how many days there are in a year.</I>)
Who can tell Julius how many days in a year?
<P>
V<SMALL>ENUS</SMALL>. Three hundred and sixty-five days and a fourth.
<P>
B<SMALL>OY</SMALL>. What d&rsquo;ye mean by &ldquo;a fourth&rdquo;?
<P>
D<SMALL>ANIEL</SMALL>. Fourth of July, of course!
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. We will hear the next scholar.
<P>
P<SMALL>UPIL</SMALL>. George was born in Washington, D.C.,
and was named for that city.
<P>
C.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;F<SMALL>ITTS</SMALL>. W-w-what d-d-does d-d-d-D.C.&nbsp;m-mean?
<P>
P<SMALL>UPIL</SMALL>. Down South, don&rsquo;t it, teacher?
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. Go on with your recitation. You ask too many questions.
<P>
P<SMALL>UPIL</SMALL>. His mother&rsquo;s maiden name was Miss Hatchet&mdash;and his
father&rsquo;s maiden name was George.
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. Next, go on.
<P>
S<SMALL>ECOND </SMALL>P<SMALL>UPIL</SMALL>. When Washington wasn&rsquo;t fighting he lived
on the top of Mount Vernon, and his tomb is in one side of the mountain.
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. What day is celebrated as his birthday?
<P>
A<SMALL>LL</SMALL> (<I>eagerly</I>). The Twenty-second of February!
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. Why should his birthday be celebrated any more than mine?
<P>
(<I>Thoughtful silence.</I>)
<P>
G<SMALL>IRL</SMALL> (<I>raising hand triumphantly</I>).
Because he never told a lie!
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. You may take your seat until you can be
more respectful to your elders.
<P>
S<SMALL>CHOLAR</SMALL> (<I>at back of room, or near door</I>). Say, teacher,
there&rsquo;s somebody knocking at the door. I guess it&rsquo;s the committee!
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. Class, toe the line! Scholars,
if any one of you gets out of order while the committee is here I&rsquo;ll flog you!
Do you understand?
<P>
C<SMALL>HORUS</SMALL>. Yes, sir!
<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL>. Martha Washington Hibbs, you may open the door.
<BR>

more easily led than driven.
But he&rsquo;s so nervous! I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;ll never live to grow up.
Whenever you see him whispering or playing in school,
Mr.&nbsp;Snodgrass, you may be sure it&rsquo;s all nervousness.
He was a-goin&rsquo; to play truant to-day, because he thinks you don&rsquo;t like him!
What a be-u-tiful school you have&mdash;sech

Won&rsquo;t you be seated?

<P>
T<SMALL>EACHER</SMALL> (<I>resuming</I>). The next may tell me about some

<P>
P<SMALL>UPIL</SMALL>. Esau lived six hundred years before Christ.
He wrote fables for a living,
and sold the copyright of them for a bottle of potash.
<P>
G<SMALL>IRL</SMALL> (<I>raising hand&nbsp;</I>). I thought it was &AElig;sop that wrote fables.

C<SMALL>OM</SMALL>. (<I>doubtfully</I>). Wal, that&rsquo;s putty straight reasonin&rsquo;,

C<SMALL>OM</SMALL>. Wall, I hed an idee that a spinster was allus a woman.
(<I>Scratching his head.</I>)
<P>
E<SMALL>IGHTH </SMALL>P<SMALL>UPIL</SMALL>. My book says that <I>er</I> means
<I>one who</I>, and anyway <I>baker</I> means one who bakes,
and <I>builder</I> means one who builds&mdash;and&mdash;
<P>
F<SMALL>IRST </SMALL>P<SMALL>UPIL</SMALL>. Does Quaker mean one who quakes?
<P>
C<SMALL>OM</SMALL>. That ain&rsquo;t to the p&rsquo;int, as I ken see!
<P>
E<SMALL>IGHTH </SMALL>P<SMALL>UPIL</SMALL>. Well, a spinster is one who spins, ain&rsquo;t it?
<P>
C<SMALL>OM</SMALL>. Mebbe, mebbe! But heow ken ye say that of Seth Crane,
that never did a useful thing in his life?
<P>
E<SMALL>IGHTH </SMALL>P<SMALL>UPIL</SMALL>. I should think that any fellar that
spins a top &rsquo;ud be a spinster.
<P>
C<SMALL>OM</SMALL>. Wal, you&rsquo;ve got me there, youngster.
I reckon ye&rsquo;re right. Next, tell me the meaning of excruciating.
<P>
G<SMALL>IRL</SMALL> (<I>glibly</I>).
Excruciating means that natural and peculiar prohibition
of undulatory and molecular attraction which encompasses
the plausibility of capillary promulgation and gelatinous hyperbole,
while giving an enallage of paradigms.
<P>
C<SMALL>OM</SMALL>. That&rsquo;s a likely gal. You&rsquo;ll make a good housekeeper
one of these days.
Ef my wife hed sech a mem&rsquo;ry as that,
I shouldn&rsquo;t carry her letters in my pocket tu weeks before mailin&rsquo; &rsquo;em.
<P>
S<SMALL>AME </SMALL>P<SMALL>UPIL</SMALL>. Yes, sir; thank you, sir.
But I don&rsquo;t quite understand what it means by
&ldquo;encompassing the plausibility of capillary promulgation&rdquo;!
<P>
C<SMALL>OM</SMALL>. Oh&mdash;ahem!&mdash;that is very simple&mdash;ahem! ahem!
in fact it is simplicity itself.
It means&mdash;it means&mdash;well,
I don&rsquo;t want to overtax your young brain, my dear, so I will not explain now;
but one of these days, when you are as wise as me and your teacher,
you will understand all these profound thoughts.
Hain&rsquo;t that so, Mr.&nbsp;Snodgrass? Next, <I>terbacker</I>.
<P>
S<SMALL>EVENTH </SMALL>P<SMALL>UPIL</SMALL>. T-e-r, <I>ter</I>&mdash;b-a-c-k,
<I>back</I>&mdash;<I>terback</I>&mdash;k-e-r, <I>ker&mdash;terbacker</I>.
A poisonous leaf with niggertine in it;
and ef the niggertine gets into the cistern,
it&rsquo;ll kill a man quicker&rsquo;n a dog.
<P>
F<SMALL>IRST </SMALL>P<SMALL>UPIL</SMALL>. I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s a poison.
My brother smokes and he ain&rsquo;t dead;
&rsquo;nd my father&rsquo;s fifty years old &rsquo;nd he&rsquo;s smoked
for most forty years &rsquo;nd he ain&rsquo;t dead yet.
<P>
F<SMALL>OURTH </SMALL>P<SMALL>UPIL</SMALL>. Pooh! That&rsquo;s nothing.
Ef your father hedn&rsquo;t smoked,
he mighter been a hundred by this time.
<P>
E<SMALL>IGHTH </SMALL>P<SMALL>UPIL</SMALL>. My grandfather&rsquo;s ninety years old and he&rsquo;s smoked too!
<P>
F<SMALL>OURTH </SMALL>P<SMALL>UPIL</SMALL>. Well, and ef <I>my</I> grandfather was alive
he&rsquo;d be a hundred and fifty years old! So that don&rsquo;t prove nothing.
<P>
T<SMALL>HIRD </SMALL>P<SMALL>UPIL</SMALL>. Tobacco ain&rsquo;t no poisoner nor pickles, anyhow.
(<I>Groan from the girls.</I>)
I went into the store t&rsquo;other day to get some pickles for ma,
and a feller&mdash;he was one o&rsquo; them city chaps that sells things&mdash;and he said,
&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t going to eat them sour green things, are you?&rdquo; and I said,
&ldquo;No, I hain&rsquo;t; why?&rdquo; And he told me of a girl seventeen years old
who eat pickuls and died! (<I>Horrified look on girls&rsquo; faces.</I>)
And they opened her stummick and them pickuls had turned everything
in it tu glass!! (<I>Confusion and whispering among the girls.

Order! The next may explain &ldquo;<I>phenomena</I>.&rdquo;

Phenomena is that immaculate preponderance of preternatural possibility
as to make an exaggerated conception of auxiliary precedents,
and oleaginous metamorphosis into an indivisible synthetical analysis.
<P>
C<SMALL>OM</SMALL>. That&rsquo;s putty good.
You hev exceeded my suspicions and I am disguised that yu should du so well.
This is the most supernatural class I ever seen.
Mr.&nbsp;Snodgrass, I congratterlate you on sech ambiguous pupils.
Gee there now and take yer seats.

Neow yeou ain&rsquo;t got no little song you can sing, hev ye?

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
||:&nbsp;(8.) And we march, march, march while singing our motion song.&nbsp;:||
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 (9.) Our fingers and thumbs are eight and two,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hurrah! Hurrah!
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s plenty of work for them to do,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hurrah! Hurrah!
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(10.) With elbows akimbo and looks so shy,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(11.) We bow to our partners so gracefully,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
||:&nbsp;(12.) And we hop and dance while singing our motion song.&nbsp;:||
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 (13.) As back and forth our arms we throw,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Heigh-ho! Heigh-ho!
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;It&rsquo;s pretty hard work now, you may know,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Heigh-ho! Heigh-ho!
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(14.) For trying our best our eyes open to keep,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(15.) We drop all our heads as if going to sleep,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
||:&nbsp;(16.) And we nod, nod, nod, while singing our motion song.&nbsp;:||
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(17.) What terrible noise is that we hear?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Dear me! Dear me!
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(18.) We&rsquo;ve all been snoozing, that&rsquo;s quite clear.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Dear me! Dear me!
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(19.) So let us take books and be ready for work,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(20.) For we are not willing our lessons to shirk,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(I didn&rsquo;t want ter write this compersition,
but pa said I must &rsquo;cause he wants me ter be a lawyer one of these days.
This is a hard world fur boys, anyway.
It doesn&rsquo;t make no diffrunce what a boy does or says,
he&rsquo;s sure ter get inter trouble.)
<P>
&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t so with girls. Everything girls does is right.
I wish&rsquo;t I was a girl. I&rsquo;m the only boy in our family,
&rsquo;nd it&rsquo;s a awful responsibility to be the only boy.
I&rsquo;ve got three sisters, but they&rsquo;re all girls.
Sis and Tom Golder took me to the city t&rsquo;other day,
and we took our dinner at a bang-up hotel, I tell you.
When the waiter arsked me ef I&rsquo;d hev the bill of fare I said,
&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; jest as perlite as I knew how,
but it made Sis mad b&rsquo;cause I told him &ldquo;Only a little piece, please.&rdquo;
How&rsquo;d I know what it was, when they hev sech outlandish names fur things!
Tom larfed and larfed; but I told the waiter he mustn&rsquo;t mind him;
he was my sister&rsquo;s feller, and I guessed he warn&rsquo;t used ter city ways;
but he was all right and as rich as a Jew.
Everybody but Sis at that was hotel seemed good-natured.
The waiter was orful jolly, too.
I pointed out to him a sickly-looking chap&mdash;Tom said he was a dude&mdash;at
an opposite table and told him that dude was eating the bouquet,
and how that feller larft!
He said it was only celery, and wouldn&rsquo;t I like some,
but I told him, &ldquo;No, thank you, I&rsquo;d ruther hev my greens cooked.&rdquo;
On the way home Sis took off her hat and put it on the seat in front of her,
without saying anything to me about it.
Ov course when I sot down that hat was right under me and feather &rsquo;nd all
was jambed flatter&rsquo;n a pancake.
Tom larfed, but Sis didn&rsquo;t. He said he guessed I thort
I was a-sittin&rsquo; on the style.
When I got home I felt&rsquo;s if I&rsquo;d been a-settin&rsquo; on a hornet&rsquo;s nest.
Pa&rsquo;s the most onreasonable man I ever seen!
He told me one day not ter pick another flower
outer the garding without leave;
so next time I was jest as keerful as I could be &rsquo;nd picked
&rsquo;em all <I>with</I> leaves.
Perhaps you won&rsquo;t believe it, but I got a thrashing fur that.
Then one dark night, as pa and me went out ter the barn,
pa run against a post,
and he said he wished that darned post was in the lower regions;
but I told him he&rsquo;d better not wish it there,
fur he might run into it again.
But what&rsquo;s the use o&rsquo; trying to help your relations?
I hed to go to bed a week right after supper, jest fur that.
But I&rsquo;d ruther do that than hev ma talk to me,
she&rsquo;s so orful sober about it.
She finished up a long talk last Sunday night with,
&ldquo;I hev tried to give you every advantage, Napoleon,
and this is how you treat me;&rdquo; and I said,
&ldquo;Of course I wouldn&rsquo;t take advantage of my ma,&rdquo; &rsquo;nd I vum ef she
didn&rsquo;t tell pa of that.
It&rsquo;s orful discouraging to be a boy.
I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t try very much longer.
I shall be glad when I&rsquo;m a lawyer,
&rsquo;cause then I can be as wicked as I want to.
(<I>Bows and returns to seat.</I>)

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
